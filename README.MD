#Collatz Conjecture

This is the Collatz Conjecture.
Written when bored.
Takes a number at messes around with it until it becomes one.
Throws away non-integers. I probably don't check for it the right way but it works.
*
	THE COLLATZ CONJECTURE STATES THAT IF YOU PICK A NUMBER, AND IF IT'S EVEN
	DIVIDE IT BY TWO AND IF IT'S ODD MULTIPLY IT BY THREE AND ADD ONE, AND IF
	YOU REPEAT THE PROCEDURE LONG ENOUGH, EVENTUALLY YOUR FRIENDS WILL STOP
	CALLING TO SEE IF YOU WANT TO HANG OUT.
	And it will also return 1.
